# simpeg-tdem-examples

There are two notebooks in this repository that demonstrate the use of the SimPEG forward modelling and inversion codes for 1D time domain EM problems. 

- tdem-1d-b-square-loop.ipynb: simulates B-field data over a layered Earth with a square loop source and inverts these data using standard least squares inversion
- tdem-1d-dbdt-sparse: simulates dbdt data over a layered Earth with a circular loop source and inverts these data using sparse and compact norms
